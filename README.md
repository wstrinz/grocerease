## NO TIME TO WRITE A PROPER README, SO EVERYTHING BELOW WAS GENERATED BY GPT-4 AND MAY BE TOTALLY INACCURATE!

This guide provides instructions for setting up the Grocery List App in a local development environment. This app is a web-based tool that allows users to upload multiple images of their handwritten grocery lists, which are then transcribed and organized into a structured format.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Redis server
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the cloned directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   cd [repository-directory]
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
   ```env
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
   SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_secret_key
   BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=your_username
   BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   Replace `your_redis_password`, `your_secret_key`, `your_username`, `your_password`, and `your_openai_api_key` with your Redis password, a secret key for sessions, basic authentication credentials, and your OpenAI API key, respectively.

4. **Start Redis Server**

   Ensure that your Redis server is running. You can start Redis using the following command:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   Start the server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   By default, the server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Access the Application**

   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the app.

## Additional Information

- The application now supports uploading multiple images at once. In the UI, users can select multiple files for upload, and on the server, each image is processed in parallel to transcribe the grocery lists efficiently.
- The AI transcription feature utilizes OpenAI's GPT model. Ensure you have a valid OpenAI API key in your `.env` file.
- Redis is used for session storage and management. Make sure your Redis server details in the `.env` file match your local Redis configuration.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues connecting to Redis, verify that the Redis server is running and the `.env` file contains the correct host, port, and password.
- For problems related to the OpenAI API, check if the API key is valid and properly set in the `.env` file.

Feel free to open an issue on the repository if you encounter any problems not covered in this guide.
